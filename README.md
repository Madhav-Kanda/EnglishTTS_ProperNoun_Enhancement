# EnglishTTS_ProperNoun_Enhancement
This repository contains code for enhancing the English Text To Speech (TTS) by working on the proper pronunciation of Indian proper nouns. We have proposed the following method:
1. Finding the Indian proper nouns in the English sentence by using the POS tags.
2. Transliterating these English written Indian names in Devanagri script.
3. Transliterating these Indian names in Devanagri script to English using a defined mapping corresponding to each possible combination of Hindi Vyanjan and Swar.
4. Converting these English written words to Arpabet based covention using a mapping.
